In late 2009, we launched our first ETFs in Europe and currently have a suite of 29 funds which are built on our strong index tracking heritage, integrated platforms and disciplined processes.
The HSBC ETF range are sub-funds of HSBC ETFs plc (“the Company”), an investment company with variable capital and segregated liability between sub-funds, incorporated in Ireland as a public limited company, and is authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland. The company is constituted as an umbrella fund, with segregated liability between sub-funds.
Our passive equity funds benefit from our physical replication approach – where our portfolios are invested in the constituents of the underlying index, and do not use synthetic instruments, such as swaps and other derivatives, to mirror index performance.
Global Asset Management
We offer equity market exposure to a range of global markets and carefully select indices where we can manage trading costs and liquidity.

We take your security very seriously. In order to protect you and our systems, we are making changes to all HSBC websites that means some of the oldest web browser versions will no longer be able to access these sites. Generally, the latest versions of a browser (like Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, etc.) and an operating system family (like Microsoft Windows, MacOS) have the most up-to-date security features.

We have successfully managed index funds for clients since 1988, with dedicated portfolio management teams across global markets, leveraging our infrastructure and expertise.
Through considered implementation, we aim to find the optimal trade-off between temporary tracking error and transaction costs. The optimal balance and duration of implementation is important in achieving this objective and ultimately improves portfolio performance over time.
At the heart of our investment process is delivering close tracking error and managing tracking error budgets, while minimising the funds’ execution costs. We have a robust track record in providing competitively priced market access solutions.
