Securitised Credit
Home
The investment characteristics of securitised credit differ from traditional debt securities. The major difference is that the principal is often paid in stages and may be fully repaid at any time because of the terms of the underlying loans. This variability in timing of cash flows makes estimates of future asset yield and weighted average life uncertain. There may also be specific risks involved when investing in securitised credit, including pre-payment risk, subordinated risk, capital value risk, economic risk, re-financing risk and liquidity risk.

We take your security very seriously. In order to protect you and our systems, we are making changes to all HSBC websites that means some of the oldest web browser versions will no longer be able to access these sites. Generally, the latest versions of a browser (like Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, etc.) and an operating system family (like Microsoft Windows, MacOS) have the most up-to-date security features.

The value of investments and any income from them can go down as well as up and investors may not get back the amount originally invested. The value of the underlying assets is strongly affected by interest rate fluctuations and by changes in the credit ratings of the underlying issuer of the assets.
