The value of investments and any income from them can go down as well as up and investors may not get back the amount originally invested.  Where overseas investments are held the rate of currency exchange may also cause the value of such investments to fluctuate. Stock market investments should be viewed as a medium to long-term investment and should be held for at least five years.

Shared insights and perspectives from the broader global investment team
We take your security very seriously. In order to protect you and our systems, we are making changes to all HSBC websites that means some of the oldest web browser versions will no longer be able to access these sites. Generally, the latest versions of a browser (like Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, etc.) and an operating system family (like Microsoft Windows, MacOS) have the most up-to-date security features.
