HSBC can support    you   by  supplementing your investment portfolio with structured products solutions ,  which can be used to access particular markets, isolate desired returns and  risks, protect against adverse market outcomes and take advantage of optimised  trading strategies. These  solutions can either be standardised  products or bespoke creations for individual clients.
