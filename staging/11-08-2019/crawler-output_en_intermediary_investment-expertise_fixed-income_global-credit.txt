Our investment approach
Please upgrade your browser
Aims to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and steady income by investing the crossover space - lower-rated investment-grade credit and higher quality high yield securities.
Certain investors are limited to investment grade credit and others to high yield. As a bond changes categories, managers are forced to sell, creating opportunities for managers that can hold transitioning bonds

Identifying, pricing and combining risks is at the core of our investment approach
We have developed a customised benchmark, the Bloomberg Barclays High Income Bond Composite Index, to expand the investment grade opportunity set globally to include higher rated high yield credit
The value of investments may go down as well as up and you may not get back the amount originally invested. Fixed income is subject to credit and interest rate risk. Investments in high yield securities (commonly referred to as “junk bonds”) are often considered speculative investments and have significantly higher credit risk than investment grade securities. The prices of high yield securities, which may be less liquid than higher rated securities, may be more volatile and more vulnerable to adverse market, economic or political conditions. Investments in emerging markets are by their nature higher risk and potentially more volatile than those inherent in some established markets. Derivatives can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on performance.
We take your security very seriously. In order to protect you and our systems, we are making changes to all HSBC websites that means some of the oldest web browser versions will no longer be able to access these sites. Generally, the latest versions of a browser (like Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, etc.) and an operating system family (like Microsoft Windows, MacOS) have the most up-to-date security features.
