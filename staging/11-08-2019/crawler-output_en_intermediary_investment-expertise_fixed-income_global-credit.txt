Identifying, pricing and combining risks is at the core of our investment approach
The value of investments may go down as well as up and you may not get back the amount originally invested. Fixed income is subject to credit and interest rate risk. Investments in high yield securities (commonly referred to as “junk bonds”) are often considered speculative investments and have significantly higher credit risk than investment grade securities. The prices of high yield securities, which may be less liquid than higher rated securities, may be more volatile and more vulnerable to adverse market, economic or political conditions. Investments in emerging markets are by their nature higher risk and potentially more volatile than those inherent in some established markets. Derivatives can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on performance.
