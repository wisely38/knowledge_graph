HSBC Global Asset Management
Our passive fixed income management follows an ‘intelligent indexation’ investment approach which focuses on two equally important objectives, close index tracking and minimising transaction costs. Both are embedded in our disciplined and diligent approach and are achieved by leveraging the expertise of our active team.

Data privacy notices
The performance of bonds, gilts and other fixed interest securities tends to be less volatile than those of shares of companies (equities). However there is a risk that both the relative yield and the capital value of these may be reduced if interest rates go up

News and insights
Income offered by bonds often reflects, in part, the risk rating of the issuer. The underlying funds can invest in sub investment grade bonds, which may produce a higher level of income than investment grade bonds, but carry increased risk of default on repayment. This may affect the level of income the investor receives and/or the capital value of their investment

We take your security very seriously. In order to protect you and our systems, we are making changes to all HSBC websites that means some of the oldest web browser versions will no longer be able to access these sites. Generally, the latest versions of a browser (like Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, etc.) and an operating system family (like Microsoft Windows, MacOS) have the most up-to-date security features.
