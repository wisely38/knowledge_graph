HSBC Global Strategy Portfolios primarily use passive investment products, to deliver cost-efficiency, namely index tracking funds and ETFs, to implement portfolio asset allocation
About HSBC
The value of investments and any income from them can go down as well as up and investors may not receive back the amount originally invested. Where overseas investments are held the rate of currency exchange may also affect the value of investments. The global nature of the funds means that part of the fund portfolios could be invested within emerging market regions. These investments are by their nature higher risk and potentially more volatile than those inherent in established markets.
