Over 40 sector specialists cover the global credit universe across investment grade, cross-over and high yield names
By investing the crossover space, we are able to target the yield potential of high yield bonds while maintaining an overall lower risk profile
We use a regional approach, breaking down the investment universe into US, Europe and emerging markets for enhanced diversification
We use our local credit management and credit research teams to determine issuer, regional, sector and credit allocations.
Certain investors are limited to investment grade credit and others to high yield.As a bond changes categories, managers are forced to sell, creating opportunities for managers that can hold transitioning bonds
Proprietary fundamental and valuation research tools are critical to our investment decisions and our risk calibration techniques
Lead portfolio managers leverage the insights of local credit analysts and portfolio managers and actively allocate across regions (US, Europe and emerging markets)
The lead fund manager allocates assets across US, Euro and emerging markets sleeves to capture different yield, quality, duration and volatility characteristics

We believe bonds in the crossover space are inefficient as technical factors and market overreactions often lead to mispricing
The strategy focuses on high yield opportunities in the US, Europe and emerging markets.We also manage a Global Short Duration High Yield Bond strategy, which aims to provide attractive returns with lower duration and volatility.
The value of investments may go down as well as up and you may not get back the amount originally invested.Fixed income is subject to credit and interest rate risk.Investments in high yield securities (commonly referred to as “junk bonds”) are often considered speculative investments and have significantly higher credit risk than investment grade securities.The prices of high yield securities, which may be less liquid than higher rated securities, may be more volatile and more vulnerable to adverse market, economic or political conditions.Investments in emerging markets are by their nature higher risk and potentially more volatile than those inherent in some established markets.Derivatives can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large negative impact on performance.
Our global credit strategies seek attractive risk-adjusted returns with an emphasis on income and yield.
Our global credit strategies invest in securities with stable or improving fundamentals, focusing on mispriced risks.

Our customised benchmark seeks to provide more attractive risk-adjusted returns over the medium-term than the traditional benchmark
The strategy invests in high yield corporate bonds with the ability to invest in investment grade or lower rated high yield bonds opportunistically
We have developed a customised benchmark, the Bloomberg Barclays High Income Bond Composite Index, to expand the investment grade opportunity set globally to include higher rated high yield credit
Many of our global credit strategies use alternatively-weighted, customised benchmarks targeting more attractive risk-adjusted returns
Our credit analysts focus on specific credits rather than ratings, allowing for continuity in coverage to provide the investment team with in-depth insights on the credit
