The value of investments and any income from them can go down as well as up and investors may not get back the amount originally invested.  Where overseas investments are held the rate of currency exchange may also cause the value of such investments to fluctuate. Stock market investments should be viewed as a medium to long-term investment and should be held for at least five years.
