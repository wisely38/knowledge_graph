Listed property securities are part of the equity market and are more volatile than direct (unlisted) property, which can mean that the price of Shares and the income from them can fluctuate, sometimes dramatically

We actively allocate between direct property funds and listed property equity funds.  Our investments are held indirectly, mainly through funds, rather than by owning buildings directly. This approach helps to access local markets quickly and easily, using specialist managers, as well as diversifying property-specific risk efficiently.

There are three reasons behind our approach to blending listed and unlisted property. Combining funds that invest in direct property with and those that invest in property equities offers potentially lower volatility of returns than would be the case from investing in equity markets alone. It also helps to maintain higher liquidity than is possible when investing only in direct property. Finally, investing in both types of property provides the opportunity to enhance returns as their relative attractiveness varies over time.

What are some of the risks when investing?
Commercial and residential property have different risk profiles and returns in one market do not necessarily follow the other. The risks involved in property investment are different from other types of investments such as equities and bonds, in that this type of investment tends to lag the economic cycle rather than lead it
