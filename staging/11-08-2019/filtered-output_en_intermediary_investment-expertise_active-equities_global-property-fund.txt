Listed property securities are part of the equity market and are more volatile than direct (unlisted) property, which can mean that the price of Shares and the income from them can fluctuate, sometimes dramatically
Property values are affected by a number of factors, including general and local economic conditions, attractiveness and location of properties, increases in local competition, financial condition of tenants, quality of maintenance, limitations on and variations in rents, level of investor demand and changes in interest rates
We actively allocate between direct property funds and listed property equity funds.  Our investments are held indirectly, mainly through funds, rather than by owning buildings directly.This approach helps to access local markets quickly and easily, using specialist managers, as well as diversifying property-specific risk efficiently.
Some of the underlying property funds will not price daily

Since 2007, the HSBC Global Property Fund has provided investors with globally-diversified access to direct (unlisted) property and listed property via quoted real estate equities in a single fund.
There are three reasons behind our approach to blending listed and unlisted property.Combining funds that invest in direct property with and those that invest in property equities offers potentially lower volatility of returns than would be the case from investing in equity markets alone.It also helps to maintain higher liquidity than is possible when investing only in direct property.Finally, investing in both types of property provides the opportunity to enhance returns as their relative attractiveness varies over time.
There are certain additional costs and risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate.These include: risk of oversupply in local markets, risk of extended vacancies within properties, property taxes and operating expenses, risk of changes in planning laws, risks relating to legal title,costs relating to environmental problems and liability risk to third parties for damages resulting from environmental problems, and uninsured damages from floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters
20 countries, investing in over 640 buildings (direct property funds), and over 100 listed property securities that own 100s of buildings plus 50+ directly-held property equities
