EMD has evolved into a complex asset class and requires specialized resources to identify opportunities and risks that may be mispriced or misunderstood. We believe EMD markets reflect fundamental values over the longer-term, but can be highly inefficient over the shorter-term.

Investments in high yield securities (commonly referred to as “junk bonds”) are often considered speculative investments and have significantly higher credit risk than investment grade securities. The prices of high yield securities, which may be less liquid than higher rated securities, may be more volatile and more vulnerable to adverse market, economic or political conditions

Fixed income is subject to credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Interest rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed income security that result from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, a portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall
Decline
The value of investments may go down as well as up and you may not get back the amount originally invested
We capture macroeconomic views, catalysts and investment themes together with detailed EM country and currency fundamentals and relative valuation metrics to guide our investment approach.Reiterative risk management is a critical to our process. We continuously assess the numerous external factors impacting EMD to fine-tune our positioning and to ensure we have optimized the portfolio for acceptable risk/return trade-offs.
