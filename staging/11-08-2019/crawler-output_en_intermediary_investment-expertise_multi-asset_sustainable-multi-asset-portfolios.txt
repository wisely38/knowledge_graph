We take your security very seriously. In order to protect you and our systems, we are making changes to all HSBC websites that means some of the oldest web browser versions will no longer be able to access these sites. Generally, the latest versions of a browser (like Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, etc.) and an operating system family (like Microsoft Windows, MacOS) have the most up-to-date security features.

About us
The value of an investment in the portfolios and any income from them can go down as well as up and as with any investment you may not receive back the amount originally invested.
The state of our planet, wellbeing of society and behaviour of corporations are all related issues with significant consequences and we believe that company performance can be positively influenced by good sustainability practices.

As the global economy evolves to address sustainability issues, it creates opportunities and risks for companies. Some will stand to gain from the adaptation of new standards and technologies. Companies that most effectively manage opportunities and risks related to sustainability should logically find long-term success.
