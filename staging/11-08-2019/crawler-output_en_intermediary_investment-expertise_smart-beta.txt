Fundamental strategies include our suite of Economic Scale Equity (ESE). Launched in June 2012, ESE strategies weigh companies by their economic footprint, aiming for better risk-adjusted returns relative to a market cap-weighted index. Our methodology was created “in house” by our quantitative research team
We calculate each company’s “value-add” — the difference between its output (sales) and inputs (its purchases of goods and services from other businesses)

A theoretically sound and intuitive approach that breaks the link between index weight and market price, enabling superior diversification and better capture of the noise that influences market prices
Risk Warning
The value of investments and any income from them can go down as well as up and investors may not get back the amount originally invested. Where overseas investments are held the rate of currency exchange may also cause the value of such investments to fluctuate.

Smart beta and factor-based investing
Polska
México
Designed to combine Value, Quality, Momentum, Small Size, and Low Risk factors and provide consistent outperformance against a market cap-weighted index with low tracking error.
Factor investing is based on the observation that stocks with certain characteristics (or more precisely, premia) have outperformed the broader market over time on a risk-adjusted basis. Allocating to factors gives investors transparent and cost effective access to these sources of returns, enabling them to better understand and manage underlying portfolio risks.

We take your security very seriously. In order to protect you and our systems, we are making changes to all HSBC websites that means some of the oldest web browser versions will no longer be able to access these sites. Generally, the latest versions of a browser (like Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Apple Safari, etc.) and an operating system family (like Microsoft Windows, MacOS) have the most up-to-date security features.
Our governance
A weighting approach that captures a company’s economic activity (its contribution to gross national product (GNP)—or its “value-add") yields stable weights with low linkage to share prices

Multi-factor strategies provide controlled exposure to multiple factors (Value, Quality, Low Risk, Small Size, Momentum) aiming for consistent outperformance relative to a traditional index equivalent and with targeted tracking error.  Through our proprietary risk models, we tailor our factor-based strategies to incorporate client-specific guidelines including bespoke tracking error levels, factor exposures and ESG constraints
We design and validate each factor from scratch. Metrics and fundamental data elements are carefully selected based on decades of experience in hands-on factor investing

The low volatility portfolio includes some less correlated, higher volatility names to reduce absolute risk
Our investment process sets us apart from more traditional low volatility approaches. We focus first on finding quality stocks (strong profitability and valuation) and then optimise for low volatility. This supports diversification and helps avoid crowded trades, sector concentration and interest rate sensitivity
Volatility focused strategies combine quantitative discipline and qualitative judgment. We capture quality companies based on attractive profitability and valuation profiles and construct a portfolio optimised for lower volatility.  Proprietary fundamental research and integrated Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) analysis are used to confirm stock volatility characteristics and whether company profitability levels can be sustained
We identify and rank quality stocks with attractive profitability and valuation profiles
