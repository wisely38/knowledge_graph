The investment characteristics of securitised credit differ from traditional debt securities. The major difference is that the principal is often paid in stages and may be fully repaid at any time because of the terms of the underlying loans. This variability in timing of cash flows makes estimates of future asset yield and weighted average life uncertain. There may also be specific risks involved when investing in securitised credit, including pre-payment risk, subordinated risk, capital value risk, economic risk, re-financing risk and liquidity risk.
