Equities
Factor investing is based on the observation that stocks with certain characteristics (or more precisely, premia) have outperformed the broader market over time on a risk-adjusted basis. Allocating to factors gives investors transparent and cost effective access to these sources of returns, enabling them to better understand and manage underlying portfolio risks.
