On August 20, the PBoC set the one year LPR at 4.25% and the five year rate at 4.85 %. Those rates will be used as the benchmark for long term loans such as household mortgages. The new one year LPR was down 6bps from 4.31% previously. It was also 10bps lower than the previous benchmark one year lending rate of 4.35
Going forward, we favour government and policy bank papers on the back of expectations that interest rates would be lower for longer, while remaining constructive on a few high beta names that should benefit from further easing measures

The National Development Reform Commission, the country’s top economic planner, in July tightened the grip on the issuance of offshore debt, curtailing developers’ appetite for new debt issuance. Specifically, developers can only issue debt to refinance outstanding foreign-currency liabilities in the next 12 months, a move intended to cool land market auctions in the country.

Financial decision making
Given the minimal difference between the new and old lending rates, we think the impact on the mortgage market will take some time to be felt. In the longer term, the premium over the LPR should better reflect each bank’s lending appetite and its own assessment of credit risks, helping develop a market driven pricing mechanism

On a month to date basis, only two of the 11 sectors included in MSCI China in August advanced, with companies in the healthcare and consumer staple rising 3.7% and 1.9%, respectively. Conversely, energy and communication services retreated 11.2% and 8.3%, reflecting concerns over an economic slowdown and a selloff in telecom companies
There are, however, signs that policymakers want to keep the runaway prices under control, with new tightening measures to rein in credit for both developers and homebuyers.

Effective from October 8, the interest rate on individual mortgages for first time homebuyers cannot be lower than the five year LPR, and the rate on loans for second time homebuyers cannot be lower than the LPR plus 60bps, according to the PBoC. Payments on outstanding mortgage loans remain unchanged
The July data on new loans came in lower than expectations, while the growth in money supply and total social financing (TSF) also moderated. Chinese banks extended RMB1.06 trillion in net loans in July, down from RMB1.66 trillion in June and falling short of expectations. The broadest measure of money supply, M2, expanded 8.1% year on year in July, down from an 8.5% increase in June. Growth in TSF softened to 10.7% from 10.9% over the same period
US China trade tensions escalated in August as both sides raised the tariffs modestly and rhetoric considerably. On the 23 rd , the US ordered American companies to find alternatives to China and dialled up tariffs after China applied duties on USD75 billion of US imports. To be sure, escalated tariffs could point to more depreciation pressure on the renminbi , but authorities may believe that a prolonged depreciation path does not seem to be in the best interests of the economy either
