Our passive equity funds benefit from our physical replication approach – where our portfolios are invested in the constituents of the underlying index, and do not use synthetic instruments, such as swaps and other derivatives, to mirror index performance.
Our leading proprietary technology ensures the efficiency and accuracy of information – supporting consistent tracking and fund performance. Our proprietary technology has been designed by our investment teams to meet their rigorous and robust requirements to ensure cost savings and better performance outcomes for our funds and investors

We take a pragmatic approach to managing ETFs with two equally important objectives: close tracking and minimising costs.
At HSBC we have traders located in key regional execution hubs. This is fundamental, as the expertise is connected to the market and exchange they operate in. This means our equity trades are handled by specialists with local knowledge, expertise and relationships, who are familiar with local service providers. At the end of the day, this can go a long way to deliver the best outcomes for investors.
