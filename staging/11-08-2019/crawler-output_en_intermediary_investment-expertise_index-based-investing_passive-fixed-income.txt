The performance of bonds, gilts and other fixed interest securities tends to be less volatile than those of shares of companies (equities). However there is a risk that both the relative yield and the capital value of these may be reduced if interest rates go up

Income offered by bonds often reflects, in part, the risk rating of the issuer. The underlying funds can invest in sub investment grade bonds, which may produce a higher level of income than investment grade bonds, but carry increased risk of default on repayment. This may affect the level of income the investor receives and/or the capital value of their investment
